This is my repository for the first project of CS6378 Advanced Operating Systems.

## Frequently used Linux commands
#### SSH into control node from MobaXterm:

ssh sxs210570@csjaws.utdallas.edu
```
(Use PuTTy if you are doing it from Windows)


#### Cloning git repository
```
git clone https://xxx_ACCESS_KEY_HERE_xxx@github.com/gskpsrikar/distributed-systems-project-1.git
```

#### SSH into dcxx machines
```
ssh sxs210570@dc01.utdallas.edu
```

#### "cd" into the project repository in the terminal
*Note: Doing this because the autofill on the csjaws machine is hanging up*

```
